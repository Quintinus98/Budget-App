# Budget-App
 My first repository. I hope it turns out fine

This Budget-App instantiates objects based on different budget categories like food, clothing, and entertainment. These objects allow for
1.  Depositing funds to each of the categories
2.  Withdrawing funds from each category
3.  Computing category balances
4.  Transferring balance amounts between categories

Have fun with it (smiles)
